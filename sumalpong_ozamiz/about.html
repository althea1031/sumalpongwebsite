            <h1 class="text-center">Historical background</h1>
            <p>The history of Ozamiz City dates back centuries, tracing its roots to the pre-colonial era when indigenous Subanen tribes inhabited the land. These tribes lived in harmony with nature, relying on hunting, fishing, and agriculture. The area was then known as "Misamis," derived from the Subanen word "kuyamis," a term for a sweet variety of coconut that was abundant in the region. <br> <br> 

              In the late 16th century, Spanish missionaries arrived, marking the beginning of Christianization in the area. To protect the settlement from pirates and marauders, the Spaniards built Fort Santiago in 1755, now known as the Cotta Fort or Fuerte de la Concepción y del Triunfo. This stone fortification became a vital defense structure and remains a prominent historical landmark today. <br> <br> 
              The city itself was officially established in 1939 and named after José F. Ozámiz, a distinguished politician, World War II hero, and former governor of Misamis Occidental. Ozamiz was known for his patriotism and dedication to public service, making him a fitting namesake for the city. During World War II, the city played a crucial role as a base for guerrilla operations against Japanese forces.
